        <p>Pseudo-class are a way to select HTML elements based 
            on their state as opposed to their HTML structure.
            You can read more about pseudo-classes here. 
            Psuedo-classes must always be applied to an 
            existing selector. Their "flag character" is the colon (":"),
            as you can see used in the below examples. Here are 
            some of the most popular psuedo-classes. 
        </p>

        <form>
            your name:
            <textarea></textarea>
            <button>submit</button>
        </form>

        <p>
            These pseudo classes are the ones you are probably 
            most familiar with, Even on this page you've probably
            noticed that links have different style than paragraph text 
            The tag by default sets the text color to blue with an
            underline, but have you ever seen a purplke link? This is 
            the "visited" psuedo-class that applies a different
            style to liunks that gthe user has already clicked. The 
            opposite of visited is "link" which is a link a user has
            not yet clicked. These two states are mutually exclusive,
            meaning a link cannot be both at the same time.

        <ol>
            <li>The hover pseudo-class is applied when the user points at an object but doesn't activate it. </li>
            <li> most commonlhy when they let gtheir mouse cursor lay on top of an element without clicking </li>
            <li>Some form factors don't support this, such as touch devices or pen suefaces</li>
